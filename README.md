# Braspag SDK for Python
Unofficial SDK for Python to integrate with Braspag payment gateway.

## Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade braspag-sdk
```

## Disclaimer
This SDK is created for personal use and is not officially supported by Braspag/Cielo.
The functionality is limited to what I need for my own projects.
You are more than welcome to contribute the functionality that you need as soon as it follows the same code style.
Fortunately, this is a very simple SDK, so it should be easy to understand and extend.
